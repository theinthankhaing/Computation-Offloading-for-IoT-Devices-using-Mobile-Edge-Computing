# Computation Offloading for IoT Devices using Mobile-Edge Computing

## Project Overview

* Make Survey on three algorithms of computation algorithms: LODCO, RLO and DPCOEM
* Comparison of those three algorithm based on thier energy consumption and execution time

## Description of Algorithms

* LODCO [Dynamic Computation Offloading for Mobile-Edge Computing with Energy Harvesting Devices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7572018)
* RLO [Learning-Based Computation Offloading for IoT Devices With Energy Harvesting](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8598893)
* DPCOEM [Parallel Offloading in Green and Sustainable Mobile Edge Computing for Delay-Constrained IoT System](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8854900)
